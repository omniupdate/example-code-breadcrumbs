# XSL Breadcrumbs

The `breadcrumb.xsl` code here provides a mechanism to build out breadcrumbs for pages in a section by recursively checking a file in each of the parent sections and the current section for the breadcrumb titles. Each breadcrumb up the tree will link to the index/default page of the section, with a final breadcrumb appearing for pages that are not index/default pages. 

 - This code assumes that a section properties file (`_props.pcf`) is being used to extract section titles for each section. 
 - If there aren't any section properties files, the XSL can be modified to check the page title of the index/default page of each section instead.
 - If the user leaves the breadcrumb value empty or enters the value of "$skip", the build out will skip the breacrumb for that folder. 

## Example

The breadcrumb code can be called from another XSL as needed to create the output in the appropriate location of the output. 

```
<xsl:call-template name="breadcrumb">
	<xsl:with-param name="path" select="$ou:dirname"/>								
</xsl:call-template>
```

### Dependencies

This code requires the files `variables.xsl` and `functions.xsl`, which are typically included for an implementation. Samples of these two files are also included in this package.
